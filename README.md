# ILSpy as a Service

This project started out as a "can we do this?" water cooler conversation I had with [discostu105](https://github.com/discostu105).
It turned out that it could be done way easier than we expected, thanks to [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy) and their
easy-to-use API.

Now it's all about improving that existing prototype and adding features to it.
So, give it a try: 

`dotnet run`

or

`dotnet watch run`

## Contributions welcome!
